# python-coding-challenge

## Getting Started

Welcome to the pdf classifier coding challenge, in this challenge you will be tasked with creating a classifier to sort pdfs into one of two categories: "document" or "powerpoint". The final classifier should be written in the pdf_classifier module, with the research notebook used to document your process.

### Prerequisites

- Pyenv (recommended) for python version management
- Poetry for dependency management

---

### Instructions

- the data folder contains "documents" and "powerpoints" folders, each containing pdfs of the respective type
- the `pdf_classifier` module should contain a function `classify_pdf` that takes a file path as input and returns the classification as a string
- the research notebook should contain your process, including any data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation
- feel free to use any python version and libraries you are comfortable with
- feel free to change the project configuration as you see fit, but please keep dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file
- don't worry about the performance of the classifier, we are more interested in your process and approach
